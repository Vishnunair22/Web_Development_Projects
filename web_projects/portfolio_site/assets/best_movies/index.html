    <h1>Best Movies of all time according to me</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Picks</h2>
    <hr noshade="noshade">
    <h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
    <p>This is an accelerating film with incredible visuals and sounds. The movie follows the events leading up to a
        drone attack mission carried by the Top Gun team. The movie has genuine emotions and hooks you to the very end.
    </p>
    <h3>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- Part 2</h3>
    <p>This conclusion to J.K Rowling's fictional tale in the movies was exceptional.If you are a Harry Potter fan I can
        not recommend this film enough.</p>
    <h3>Free Guy</h3>
    <p>This is a fun filled film with a different take on the RPG world. The movie is very enjoyable and engaging to the
        very end.</p>
